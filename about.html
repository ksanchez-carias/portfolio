        <p>SMASH Wharton!An ivy leage school is funding a Summer Math and Science Honors Program. During the 2017-2018 school year, I was recommended for this elite STEM program. Through my hardwork, I was lucky enough to be selected out of hundreds of other students. I am currently one of the 35 students. The program is very educational and fun. It involves STEM courses  of course ,however we have workshops that demonstrate skills that we can use in our real life. This program is filled with amazing teacher and multiple oppurtunities to create connections.   </p>
