        <p>SMASH@Wharton! An ivy league school is hosting this summer STEM academy operated by Level The Playing Field. During the 2017-2018 school year, I was recommended for this elite STEM program. Through my hard work, I was lucky enough to be selected out of hundreds of other students. I am currently one of the 35 students. The program is very educational and fun. It involves Biology, Mathematics, Design Thinking, Computer Science, Economics and Marketing courses, however we also have workshops that demonstrate skills that we can use in our everyday life. This program is filled with amazing teachers and multiple opportunities to create connections.</p>
